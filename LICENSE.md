## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the
software to do everything you might do with the software
that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright
in it for any permitted purpose.  However, you may
only distribute the software according to [Distribution
License](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works
based on the software according to [Changes and New Works
License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

## Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license
to distribute copies of the software **ONLY** under the following conditions:

1. **Source Code Distribution**: You may distribute the source code in its original or modified form, provided that:
   - You include a complete copy of this license
   - You do not distribute compiled binaries without explicit written permission
   - You do not provide automated build services that produce binaries for third parties

2. **Binary Distribution**: You may NOT distribute pre-built binaries of this software without explicit written permission from the licensor. This includes:
   - Direct executable distribution
   - Automated build services (CI/CD pipelines that produce downloadable binaries)
   - Package managers (winget, chocolatey, scoop, etc.)
   - Any other form of compiled distribution

3. **Personal Use Exception**: You may compile and use the software for your own personal use without restriction.

## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines
beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided
with the software.

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
make changes and new works based on the software for any
permitted purpose, subject to the following restrictions:

1. You may not create derivative works that primarily serve as a substitute for the software
2. You may not create automated tools that build and distribute binaries of this software
3. You may not wrap this software in a service that competes with the licensor's distribution

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

## Noncompete

Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for:

1. **Providing any product that competes with the software or any product the licensor or any of its affiliates provides using the software.**

2. **Operating automated build-from-source services** — Any service, platform, or tool that:
   - Accepts this software's source code as input
   - Automatically compiles/builds the software
   - Distributes the resulting binaries to third parties
   - This includes CI/CD services, automated build bots, and "build farms"

3. **Redistributing binaries** — Creating, hosting, or distributing pre-compiled executables of this software without written permission

## Competition

Goods and services compete even when they provide functionality
through different kinds of interfaces or for different technical
platforms.  Applications can compete with services, libraries
with plugins, frameworks with development tools, and so on,
even if they're written in different programming languages
or for different computer architectures.  Goods and services
compete even when provided free of charge.  If you market a
product as a practical substitute for the software or another
product, it definitely competes.

**Specifically prohibited competing activities include:**
- Offering pre-built binaries of this software for download
- Providing automated build services that produce downloadable binaries
- Including this software in package managers or app stores
- Creating "unofficial" builds or forks with binary distribution

## New Products

If you are using the software to provide a product that does
not compete, but the licensor or any of its affiliates brings
your product into competition by providing a new version of
the software or a new product using the software, you may
continue using versions of the software available under these
terms beforehand to provide your competing product, but not
any later versions.

## Discontinued Products

You may begin using the software to compete with a product
or service that the licensor or any of its affiliates has
stopped providing, unless the licensor includes a plain-text
line beginning with `Licensor Line of Business:` with the
software that mentions that line of business.

## Sales of Business

If the licensor or any of its affiliates sells a line of
business developing the software or using the software
to provide a product, the buyer can also enforce
[Noncompete](#noncompete) for that product.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***

## Definitions

terms, and the **software** is the software the licensor makes
available under these terms.

**You** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these
terms.

**Your company** is any legal entity, sole proprietorship,
