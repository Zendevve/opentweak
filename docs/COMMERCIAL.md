- Building is free (no paywall for functionality)
- Fee is only for convenience

### Protection

- Prevents unauthorized commercial exploitation
- Prevents "free rider" problem

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I pay once and share with friends?

No. Each user must purchase their own license or build from source. The fee is per-user, not per-copy.

### Q: Can I get a refund?

Refunds are handled through BuyMeACoffee's policies. Contact support if you have issues.

### Q: What if I build from source and give the binary to a friend?

This violates the license. Your friend must either:
- Build from source themselves, or
- Purchase a license

### Q: Can I include OpenTweak in my game bundle?

No. You cannot redistribute binaries, even as part of a bundle.

### Q: I'm a YouTuber/streamer. Can I distribute to viewers?

No. You can:
- Show how to build from source
- Link to the BuyMeACoffee page
- Demonstrate the software

But you cannot give viewers pre-built binaries.

### Q: Can I charge for building OpenTweak for clients?

No. You cannot offer "build services" that produce binaries for others. Each client must build themselves or purchase.

### Q: What about corporate environments?

Companies can:
- Purchase individual licenses for employees
- Build from source for internal deployment
- Modify for internal use

But cannot redistribute binaries outside the organization.
